# Textitor
This is the official source code for my personal AI-integrated word processor, called Textitor (Tex - ti - tor).

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
When you see the code, the places where the OpenAI code is supposed to be, it's replaced with "openai-key-here". That means that when you get the code, you need to replace it with **YOUR** OpenAI API Key. You can access it from this website: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
