# Textitor
This is the official source code for my AI-integrated word processor, called Textitor (Tex - ti - tor).

# UPDATES
1. Textitor is now integrated into SupeNux's CLI NuxShell! Go to it's GitHub page here: https://www.github.com/gautamritvik/SupeNux-NuxShell

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
When you see in the code, places where the OpenAI API key is supposed to be, it's replaced with "openai-key-here". That means that when you get the source code, you need to replace it with **YOUR OWN** OpenAI API Key. This is the OpenAI website to generate your API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-key

# How it works
How Textitor works behind the scenes is that, first of all, Textitor is made completely by Python, so the code is quite simple to understand. So, as any word processor, it allows you to bolden, italicize, and (currently W.I.P.) underline text. It also has AI integrated, so when you press any of the AI buttons, it can check your grammar, etc.
