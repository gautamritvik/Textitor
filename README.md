# Textitor
This is the official source code for my personal AI-integrated word processor, called Textitor (Tex - ti - tor).

=================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
When you see in the code, places where the OpenAI API key is supposed to be, it's replaced with "openai-key-here". That means that when you get the source code, you need to replace it with **YOUR OWN** OpenAI API Key. You can access it from this website: https://platform.openai.com/api-key
